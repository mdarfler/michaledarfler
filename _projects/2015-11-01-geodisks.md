Part toy, part geometry lesson, the geodisks were conceived to make tangible the some of the abstract concepts of three-dimensional geometry. Each disk is laser cut from polypropylene sheets so that they fit together to build a multitude of regular geometric solids. Accompanying printed cards provide layered information on each of the different solid's geometric properties as well as their physical construction.
