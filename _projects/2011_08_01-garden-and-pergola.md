Situated on 20 acres of fields and woods the work has been focused on improving the grounds surrounding this two-story upstate farmhouse vernacular home.

### PHASE 1
The first phase was to create a fenced in garden with raised beds to compliment the existing garden in the back which was becoming more shaded over the years. The fence posts and pergola were built with pegged, mortise-and-tenon joinery without the use of any metal fasteners. Locally harvested and milled black locust was selected for maximum weather resistance. All lattice work was made with woven strips of locust.

{% endfor %}

### PHASE 2
The second stage, completed in 2012 was a walkway and arbor which created a connection with the road while simultaneously providing privacy through the use of plantings along the road-side. Hand-hewn, irregular flagstone from Pennsylvania was selected for the walkway for its natural beauty and the arbor was built from locally harvested and milled white pine. Hand-cut, pegged, mortise-and-tenon joinery mirrored the existing pergola in the garden.
